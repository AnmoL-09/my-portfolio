      Learning by doing, following what interests me,
      and trying to build things that feel solid and impactful.
      I try to stay aware that {' '}
    <span className={`${newsreader.className} italic font-semibold text-white`}> 
      everything around me 
      is the result of someone else's time and effort.

      Right now, I just want to code. 
      I want to build things, try out new tools,
       dig deeper into the Linux ecosystem,
        and understand how things work under the hood. 
        It's exciting to keep learning and see how all 
        the pieces fit together.
